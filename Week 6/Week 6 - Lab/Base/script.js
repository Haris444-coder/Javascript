/**
 * Interactive To-Do List App Lab Instructions
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Goal: Your task is to replicate the functionality of an Interactive To-Do List App.
 * Example Link: https://65c05e60f775d9e1599d7e3d--luminous-gnome-0e03fd.netlify.app/
 *
 * Key Functions to Implement:
 * 1. Allow users to add new tasks to the list. Popup and alert if the box is empty.
 * 2. Enable marking tasks as completed and removing them from the list.
 * 3. Use a 3-second delay before a task is removed after being marked as complete.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Use 'addEventListener' for handling user interactions (add, complete, remove).
 * - Understand how to traverse the DOM using properties like 'parentElement', 'children', and sibling elements.
 * - Learn how to dynamically create and manipulate elements using 'createElement', 'appendChild', and 'insertBefore'.
 * - Practice manipulating classes using 'className' and 'classList'.
 * - Implement a delay in task removal using 'setTimeout'.
 *
 * Lab Bonus:
 * 1. Add a smooth transition animation when tasks are marked as complete and removed from the list.
 * 2. Implement task filtering to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only pending tasks.
 * 3. Implement a search feature to filter and highlight tasks by their names or descriptions.
 *
 * Good luck!
