/**
 * Custom Pizza Order Form Lab Instructions
 * ----------------------------------------
 *
 * Goal:
 * - Your task is to replicate the functionality of a Custom Pizza Order Form.
 *
 * Example Link:
 * - https://65cbaf0ba001e903cbeb4179--dulcet-kashata-b01fe0.netlify.app/
 *
 * Key Functions to Implement:
 * 1. Capture Personal Information:
 *    - Allow users to enter their name. Ensure a custom validity message, "Please enter your name,"
 *      appears if the submission is attempted without filling this out.
 *
 * 2. Pizza Customization Options:
 *    - Size: Provide radio button options for Small, Medium (default), and Large pizzas.
 *    - Crust: Offer radio button choices among Thin, Pan Pizza (default), and Stuffed crusts.
 *    - Toppings: Enable multiple selections through checkboxes for toppings like Pepperoni, Mushrooms, and Onions.
 *
 * 3. Dynamic Pricing Details:
 *    - Calculate and display the Subtotal based on the user's selections.
 *    - Calculate and display the Tax (at a rate of 13%) and the Final Total.
 *
 * Note:
 * - You MAY need to learn to use querySelector and querySelectorAll to effectively select and manipulate form elements based on their classes.
 * - Use addEventListener for form submission and input changes to validate the form and calculate prices in real-time.
 * - Implement custom validity for input fields to provide informative feedback to the user.
 *
 * Lab Bonus:
 * 1. Expand Personal Information: Extend the personal information section to include an address field. Add validation to ensure both the name and address fields are filled out before submission.
 * 2. Coupon Code Discount: Add a field for users to enter a coupon code. Implement logic to validate the code (e.g., PIZZADISCOUNT10) and apply a 10% discount to the total price for valid codes.Display an alert for invalid codes.
 *
 * Good luck!
