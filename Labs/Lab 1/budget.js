/**
 * Budget Tracker App Lab Instructions
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * Goal: Your task is to replicate the functionality of a Budget Tracker App.
 * Example Link: https://65a9f4c4910e3845f9854b59--illustrious-nougat-1e8601.netlify.app/
 *
 * Key Functions to Implement:
 * 1. Calculate the net balance by subtracting total expenses from income.
 * 2. Display a message indicating if the user is over or under budget and by how much.
 * 3. Show descriptions of each expense type when hovered over.
 * 4. Clear the description box when the mouse is moved away from an expense.
 *
 * Note:
 * - You will need to use 'parseFloat' to convert input string values to numbers.
 *   Research how to use 'parseFloat' for this purpose.
 * - Learn how to implement 'onmouseout' to clear the description box.
 * - Here are all the expense descriptions so you can copy/paste them:
 *      Housing: Mortgage or rent payments
 *      Food: Grocery and dining out
 *      Transportation: Vehicle maintenance and fuel
 *      Utilities: Electricity, water, etc.
 *      Insurance: Health, car, home insurance
 * Lab Bonus:
 * 1. Add validation to check if any box is empty and set the default value to 0.
 * 2. Remove the 'Calculate' button. Instead, calculate the budget and show the
 *    message dynamically as the user enters or changes any numbers in the input fields.
 *
 * Good luck!
